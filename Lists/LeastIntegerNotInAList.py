'''Write a function that prints the least integer that is not present in a given list and cannot be represented by the summation of the sub-elements of the list.

E.g. For a = [1,2,5,7] the least integer not represented by the list or a slice of the list is 4, and if a = [1,2,2,5,7] then the least non-representable integer is 18.'''
