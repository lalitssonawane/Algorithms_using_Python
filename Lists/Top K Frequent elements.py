# Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.
#
# For example,
# Given [1,1,1,2,2,3] and k = 2, return [1,2].
#
# Note:
# You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.
# Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.
