'''
Given a list of integers, write a function that will return a list, in which for each index the element will be the product of all the integers except for the element at that index

For example, an input of [1,2,3,4] would return [24,12,8,6] by performing [2×3×4,1×3×4,1×2×4,1×2×3]

    # Set initial product and index for greedy run forward

    while i < len(lst):

        # Set index as cumulative product
